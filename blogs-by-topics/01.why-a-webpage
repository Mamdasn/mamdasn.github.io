<h5>Why a Webpage?</h5>
<p>
    As of just recently I noticed that simple static webpages are more aesthetically pleasing and also highly more efficient rather than those of javascript internet chokers. Since then, I was looking for an opportunity to have my own webpage up in the internet to be able to rant on about anything I desire, but now, that there is a time to spare, I realize that there is not much left in my mind to rant on about.

    Moving on, on this page I am going to talk about the thoughts that occupy space in my mind the most, the things I'd like to do in the future and also my to-do lists.
