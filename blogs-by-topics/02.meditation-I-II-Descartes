<h4>Descartes, A Super Concise Summary of Meditation I & II</h4>

<h5>Med I. What can be called into doubt</h5>
<p>
Establishing Doubt
<br>
*not just a simple doubt, the kind of radical methodological doubt (in which "radical" part means we are doubting everything, and nothing escapes, and the "methodological" part means it is systematic and just for the sake of this meditation (it's a thought experiment), and "doubt" means suspension of belief).
</p>
<p>
FOUNDATIONALISM
<br>
he is in search of a FOUNDATION (an indubitable starting point), which is critical to the way that he is approaching his epistemological problems.
</p>
<p>
Three distinct arguments that Descarts offers for why it is that we should doubt, and what we should doubt
<br>
1. Appeal to fallibility of the senses
<br>
2. I might be dreaming
<br>
*Simple universals include things like: Corporeal nature in general, extension, size, shape, quantity, number, place and time
<br>
3. Evil Deceiver
<br>
*Complete Doubt
</p>

<h5>Med II. The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than body</h5>
<p>
Cogito ergo sum (I am thinking, I exist)
<br>
*This cannot be coherently doubted.
</p>
<p>
I am thinking, I exist (ergo is not actually an ergo)
</p>

<p>
Thinking: Affirming, Denying, Doubting, Perceiving, Imagining, etc.
</p>


<p>
SOLIPSISM 
<br>
The only thing that exists at the end of this meditation is Descartes/me.
