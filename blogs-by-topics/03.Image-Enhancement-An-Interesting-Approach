<h4>-An interesting approach to image enhancement</h4>
<p>
Recently, I started to write codes for image manipulation and improvement, and unfortunately I don't have a community around me. So I would appreciate if you check out my codes, give me feedback and tell me what you want me to code next.

Code is here: <a href="https://github.com/Mamdasn/im2dhisteq">Two Dimensional Image Contrast Enhancement</a>

This module makes details more prominent and gets rid of haziness in images. I also tried it on videos and the outputs were satisfactory as well.

As it is depicted in the above GIF, this module tries to utilize all available brightness range (0, 255), and by doing so, contrast between sections in the image is increased.
