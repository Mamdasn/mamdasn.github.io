<h4> -BEING PAINFULLY FRANK </h4>

<p>
In this short expression of my mind, in short SEOMM, I want to go on and talk about how much it's important for one to talk their mind out, without being so called "polite", i.e imprudently hesitant, that feeds from one's annoying inner social-construct conservatism.

Since I have been living in Berlin, I have noticed people here are getting more and more reluctant to talk their mind out about really important things, such as other people culture and beliefs. Most of people would either act as if you are the stereotypical version of the country you are from and at the same time they could consider you as a friend, for my case it's somewhere in middle-east, but also with the phone ready for a quick dial to the police, or straight not talk to you because you are the devil to repel. Taking their's countries freedom and "democracy" for granted is a subject that is not spared a slight mind in these people's mind. They don't stop for a bit to think how their countries got the riches and wealth which their "democracy" and "freedom of speech" is built upon. The number of countries with gold underneath their soil that gotten taken over by mostly European countries are countless, and nobody is paying attention to what people went through in those wretched subjugated countries. Democracy is a contemporary phenomenon and when European subjugators were delaying those land-rich poorly managed countries' democracy, they only cared about their pockets. By suffocating those countries' blossoming democracy in the cradle the chaos that the world witnesses in the Middle East ensued. What I am pinpointing is not a case of them paying back the riches they have already stolen from others, which they should and I will talk about it later, this is only the just expectation from them to at least not be blindfold about it. If some white people think all middle-easterns are terrorists because of what happened to the twin sister buildings in one country, what should they feel about themselves, if they are really not reasoning like their caveman tribal-based ancestors, if they knew how much their countries' wealth is tainted with the blood of the people of those dismal-destined god-forsaken lands. If middle-east is not suitable for living as the piling cases of human rights is showcasing, the people who disturbed the peace and postponed it for at least a century by killing the baby - democracy - in the cradle also should feel the burden of those brutality occurring daily in there. The shortsightedness in this case is ... (to be continued)
