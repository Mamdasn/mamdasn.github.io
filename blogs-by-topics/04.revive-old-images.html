    From sometimes ago, actually since I finished my bachelor, I actively have been looking for subjects that I can related to and involve creation. I'm sure at a point in my life I had a switch flicked in my head making me realize how much it is facinating when a piece of art, music or even an engineered piece of work is created. Throughout my bachelor study I figured, the purpose of engineering is not only utilizing mathematics/physics and different materials for a solution to be created. The morality of the proposed solutions also plays a major role for them to be considered. An extreme case that shows the importance of the ethics in engineering is the situation of jewish people before and during the rise of nazi party. As nazi propaganda was being implemented, they tired to take the narrative in their hands to distort the history and culture of jewish people to fool the mass to support their ethnic cleansing plans. During their rule, professional photographers were using cutting-edge equipments to make pictures with the purpose of dehumanizing jewish people. There were a number of companies that made a name from other people's misery just pushing for more profit. Imagine a collective resistance from the engineering communities with the aim to at least delay the development in the camera industry or any other industries. This resistance could have scathed the body of the propaganda machinery leading to more people being saved from the engineering-backed attrocities. It was in this period when some courageous photographers such as Henryk Ross made a wager on their life with their thirst to reveal the truth by secretly taking pictures of the jewish people and documenting the harsh realities and everyday life of them. Since these pictures were taken covertly, their quality and light contrast were not assessed before taking them.

    Image contrast enhancement is a field of study in image processing with the purpose of enhancing quality. The objective is to make the important information, that already exist in the image, more prominent. Usually this transformation makes the picture to look more appealing as the quality and the contrast of the image are improved. There is a lengthy list of methods to enhance the quality/contrast of images, and day by day new methods are added to the list. I have implemented some methods and put them on my <a href="https://github.com/Mamdasn">Github page</a>. A list of methods I have implemented is:
    <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/Mamdasn/im2dhisteq">Two-dimensional histogram equalization and contrast enhancement</a> </li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/Mamdasn/imhblpce">Histogram-Based Locality-Preserving Contrast Enhancement</a> </li>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/Mamdasn/imWeightedThresholdedheq">Fast Image/Video Contrast Enhancement Based on Weighted Thresholded Histogram Equalization</a> </li>
    </ul>
