    Like everyone else I like taking photos, but I rather take analog photos. There is something about them that is hard to describe, but I will give it a try. A normal 35 mm analog cameras only allow a fairly low number of images in one go, i.e. a film can contain up to about 36 images. This restriction means I do not have a lot of space for making mistakes, however exactly because of this reason, it forces me to be sharp capturing a slippery moment with the seemingly perfect exposure, focus and etc not to let it easily wriggle out of my hands. There is also the longing for what the images are going to turn out whilst waiting for the store to develop them, that makes it special.

    Another way to capture analog photos but skip waiting for the store to develop them is to use an instant camera. After some delibiration, I decided to go with old spectra system polaroid cameras. They not only look stylish but also feel premium. I bought a Polaroid Image 2 and a Polaroid Image System. The former only lets you switch between 3 different exposure levels, but the Polaroid Image System, as shown below, offers much more functionalities - for more details refer to <a href="https://www.polaroid-passion.com/manuel/manuel-polaroid-image-spectra.pdf#page=5">url</a>. It even has a built-in solar autofocus system that shows you how far the object in focus is. Since the production of spectra films ceased in 2019, I moded my polaroid to accept the newer films such as 600 and i-type, and also, with a lot of difficulty, connected it to 4 conventional 1.5v batteries. The 600 films include a battery inside them that matches the specs of the spectra system cameras, but it doesn't seem sane to me to be willing to pay extra for the included battery when I can use the 1.5v batteries for about 10 packs of i-type films. There are some visible artifacts in the image coming out of the camera. It mostly can be attributed to the rollers inside the camera. The distance between the rollers, and consequently the pressure they put on the image when coming out of the camera, should be fixed by trial and error to match the i-type, or 600 films. But for me the artifact is acceptible and adds it's own twist.

    <p>I will put the url to the video I followed to open up the camera to access the internals and connect the batteries to the power supply circuitry. <a href="https://youtu.be/InA3IzhkKg8?si=AtxbEGw3wwvEluM9">Video Link</a></p>
