<h4> -BEING PAINFULLY FRANK </h4>
                        
                        <p>
                        In this short expression of my mind, in short SEOMM, I want to go on and talk about how much it's important for one to talk their mind out, without being so called "polite", i.e imprudently hesitant, that feeds from one's annoying inner social-construct conservatism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Since I have been living in Berlin, I have noticed people here are getting more and more reluctant to talk their mind out about really important things, such as other people culture and beliefs. Most of people would either act as if you are the stereotypical version of the country you are from and at the same time they could consider you as a friend, for my case it's somewhere in middle-east, but also with the phone ready for a quick dial to the police, or straight not talk to you because you are the devil to repel. Taking their's countries freedom and "democracy" for granted is a subject that is not spared a slight mind in these people's mind. They don't stop for a bit to think how their countries got the riches and wealth which their "democracy" and "freedom of speech" is built upon. The number of countries with gold underneath their soil that gotten taken over by mostly European countries are countless, and nobody is paying attention to what people went through in those wretched subjugated countries. Democracy is a contemporary phenomenon and when European subjugators were delaying those land-rich poorly managed countries' democracy, they only cared about their pockets. By suffocating those countries' blossoming democracy in the cradle the chaos that the world witnesses in the Middle East ensued. What I am pinpointing is not a case of them paying back the riches they have already stolen from others, which they should and I will talk about it later, this is only the just expectation from them to at least not be blindfold about it. If some white people think all middle-easterns are terrorists because of what happened to the twin sister buildings in one country, what should they feel about themselves, if they are really not reasoning like their caveman tribal-based ancestors, if they knew how much their countries' wealth is tainted with the blood of the people of those dismal-destined god-forsaken lands. If middle-east is not suitable for living as the piling cases of human rights is showcasing, the people who disturbed the peace and postponed it for at least a century by killing the baby - democracy - in the cradle also should feel the burden of those brutality occurring daily in there. The shortsightedness in this case is ... (to be continued)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        + depth research on how people from specially middle-east are treated here.
                        </p>

<h4>-Descartes, A Super Concise Summary of Meditation I & II</h4>
                        
                        <h5>Med I. What can be called into doubt</h5>
                        <p>
                        Establishing Doubt
                        <br>
                        *not just a simple doubt, the kind of radical methodological doubt (in which "radical" part means we are doubting everything, and nothing escapes, and the "methodological" part means it is systematic and just for the sake of this meditation (it's a thought experiment), and "doubt" means suspension of belief).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        FOUNDATIONALISM
                        <br>
                        he is in search of a FOUNDATION (an indubitable starting point), which is critical to the way that he is approaching his epistemological problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Three distinct arguments that Descarts offers for why it is that we should doubt, and what we should doubt
                        <br>
                        1. Appeal to fallibility of the senses
                        <br>
                        2. I might be dreaming
                        <br>
                        *Simple universals include things like: Corporeal nature in general, extension, size, shape, quantity, number, place and time
                        <br>
                        3. Evil Deceiver
                        <br>
                        *Complete Doubt
                        </p>
                        
                        <h5>Med II. The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than body</h5>
                        <p>
                        Cogito ergo sum (I am thinking, I exist)
                        <br>
                        *This cannot be coherently doubted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I am thinking, I exist (ergo is not actually an ergo)
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Thinking: Affirming, Denying, Doubting, Perceiving, Imagining, etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                        SOLIPSISM 
                        <br>
                        The only thing that exists at the end of this meditation is Descartes/me.
                        </p>

<h4>-Why a Webpage?</h4>
                        <p>
                        As of just recently I noticed that simple static webpages are more aesthetically pleasing and also highly more efficient rather than those of javascript internet chokers. Since then, I was looking for an opportunity to have my own webpage up in the internet to be able to rant on about anything I desire, but now, that there is a time to spare, I realize that there is not much left in my mind to rant on about.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Moving on, on this page I am going to talk about the thoughts that occupy space in my mind the most, the things I'd like to do in the future and also my to-do lists.
                        </p>
