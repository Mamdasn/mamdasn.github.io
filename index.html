<h4>-An interesting approach to image enhancement</h4>
                        <p>
                        Recently, I started to write codes for image manipulation and improvement, and unfortunately I don't have a community around me. So I would appreciate if you check out my codes, give me feedback and tell me what you want me to code next.
                        </p>

                        Code is here: <a href="https://github.com/Mamdasn/im2dhisteq">Two Dimensional Image Contrast Enhancement</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This module makes details more prominent and gets rid of haziness in images. I also tried it on videos and the outputs were satisfactory as well.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>

                        <center>

                        <p>
                        As it is depicted in the above GIF, this module tries to utilize all available brightness range (0, 255), and by doing so, contrast between sections in the image is increased.

<h4>-Descartes, A Super Concise Summary of Meditation I & II</h4>
                        
                        <h5>Med I. What can be called into doubt</h5>
                        <p>
                        Establishing Doubt
                        <br>
                        *not just a simple doubt, the kind of radical methodological doubt (in which "radical" part means we are doubting everything, and nothing escapes, and the "methodological" part means it is systematic and just for the sake of this meditation (it's a thought experiment), and "doubt" means suspension of belief).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        FOUNDATIONALISM
                        <br>
                        he is in search of a FOUNDATION (an indubitable starting point), which is critical to the way that he is approaching his epistemological problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Three distinct arguments that Descarts offers for why it is that we should doubt, and what we should doubt
                        <br>
                        1. Appeal to fallibility of the senses
                        <br>
                        2. I might be dreaming
                        <br>
                        *Simple universals include things like: Corporeal nature in general, extension, size, shape, quantity, number, place and time
                        <br>
                        3. Evil Deceiver
                        <br>
                        *Complete Doubt
                        </p>
                        
                        <h5>Med II. The nature of the human mind, and how it is better known than body</h5>
                        <p>
                        Cogito ergo sum (I am thinking, I exist)
                        <br>
                        *This cannot be coherently doubted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I am thinking, I exist (ergo is not actually an ergo)
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        Thinking: Affirming, Denying, Doubting, Perceiving, Imagining, etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                        SOLIPSISM 
                        <br>
                        The only thing that exists at the end of this meditation is Descartes/me.
                        </p>

<h4>-Why a Webpage?</h4>
                        <p>
                        As of just recently I noticed that simple static webpages are more aesthetically pleasing and also highly more efficient rather than those of javascript internet chokers. Since then, I was looking for an opportunity to have my own webpage up in the internet to be able to rant on about anything I desire, but now, that there is a time to spare, I realize that there is not much left in my mind to rant on about.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Moving on, on this page I am going to talk about the thoughts that occupy space in my mind the most, the things I'd like to do in the future and also my to-do lists.
                        </p>
