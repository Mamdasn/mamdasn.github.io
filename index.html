    <p>My name is Farhad Sabrian. Currently, I'm pursuing computer science at FU Berlin, though my academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. My interests lie in literature, philosophy, and politics. I have a fondness for spending time in cafes, engaging in chess matches with friends or even strangers. When it comes to lake swims, especially in the summer, it's an invitation I simply can't decline.</p>

    <p>
    It has been a while that I am spending my time on computers and although it had it's ups and downs, over all, I am satisfied with the relation I have nurtured between my fingers and the computer screen. It has been a tremendously liberating experience working with computers and telling them what to do. To be honest there have been many cases that I found myself talking to my laptop elaborating what I want it to do to only find my fingers later typing and translating what I said into the computer language. Of course there are times that what is inside cannot be translated, so eventhough the laptop cannot react, still the laptop with its fan off just sits there calmly and listens. It was one of these times that a spark in my mind inflamed. From the chronical context of that period, I should say for me and many others, it was a time of anguish and rage. Around that time Mahsa Amini was killed and many were protesting all around the corner in Berlin. The sorrow of the murder was like a quiver stuck in my heart for the longest time. After a little bit of meditation over the eagle view of the problem, I realized being quiet is not an option. So I started letting my fingers go.
    </p>
    <p>
    Throughout the time I was participating in protests, I figured, there is no platform out there that facilitates access to the registered protests on <a href="https://www.berlin.de/polizei/service/versammlungsbehoerde/versammlungen-aufzuege">Berlin.de</a>. This was the aim of my code development. After a long time of development, I was able to successfully deploy a telegram bot that is at command on the finger's hit and has a lot of potential in utilizing the information provided on <a href="https://www.berlin.de/polizei/service/versammlungsbehoerde/versammlungen-aufzuege">Berlin.de</a>. To let the code talk for itself, I will not dive more into it and will just provide a link and a picture of the telegram bot, <a href="https://t.me/ProtestsBerlinBot">@ProtestsBerlinBot</a>.

<h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Boredom activity: gravity defying flowers</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
	Yesterday, I was routinely cleaning my room. At some point, I realized that the flowers in a jar on my table, with their heads drooping downwards, were completely dried. Since the drying has made the flowers light in weight, I figured, for each one I can use a small magnet to sustain its weight in any direction.

    </div>
    <p>
    The flower heads appear to droop upwards in the set up scene. They are pointing up in defiance with the gravity pulling them down. Some of the flowers support the weight of others. The second picture, captured from below, gives the impression of the flowers standing upright. They touch the surface at a slim contact point. The narrow touchpoint and the delicate bulky flower heads rooting against gravity convey a combined contrasted expression of fragility, unreliability, commitment, and eagerness.

	Recently, I've observed that minimalist static webpages not only possess superior aesthetics but are also markedly more efficient than their JavaScript-heavy counterparts. Following this realization, I've been eager to establish my own digital space, allowing me to express myself in a new way. To be specific, I intend to share insights that captivate my curiosity, ideas that resonate during reflections in the stillness of the night, and my to-do lists.
