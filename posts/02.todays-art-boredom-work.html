	Yesterday, I was routinely cleaning my room. At some point, I realized that the flowers in a jar on my table, with their heads drooping downwards, were completely dried. Since the drying has made the flowers light in weight, I figured, for each one I can use a small magnet to sustain its weight in any direction.

            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    The flower heads appear to droop upwards in the set up scene. They are pointing up in defiance with the gravity pulling them down. Some of the flowers support the weight of others. The second picture, captured from below, gives the impression of the flowers standing upright. They touch the surface at a slim contact point. The narrow touchpoint and the delicate bulky flower heads rooting against gravity convey a combined contrasted expression of fragility, unreliability, commitment, and eagerness.
