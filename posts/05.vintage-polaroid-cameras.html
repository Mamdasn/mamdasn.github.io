    I had a hard time in the past two months, and I tried to prevail out of the continuing chest-muscle-contracting grief by drowing myself in a new hobby, analog cameras. I wasn't that much aware of such magical mechanical devices until a friend gifted me a onetime use camera. That camera piqued my interest in analog photography, however in hindsight, it seemed it was an abolute mechanical trash waste, as in I could only take 24 photos with it, and although the camera could have definitely continued working with a fresh new film canister, I had to irreversibly dismantle it to get the canister out. It was then when I realized I want to invest in an analog camera, so I started looking into it. A standard 35mm film canister has a fairly limited number of frames. This restriction has a silver lining. Despite not having a lot of space for making mistakes, this very restriction pushes me only to be more sharp when capturing slippery moments not letting them easily wriggle out of my hands. So after much deliberation, I decided to go with a Canon T70. I would share a list of hand-picked photoes in another post later.

    Instant cameras also fit in the same category of marvelous engineering. I found two cheap old spectra system polaroid cameras online, and proceeded to collect them both, a Polaroid Image 2 and a Polaroid Image System. They not only look stylish but also feel premium. The former only lets you switch between 3 different exposure levels, but the Polaroid Image System, as shown above, offers much more functionalities - for more details refer to <a href="https://www.polaroid-passion.com/manuel/manuel-polaroid-image-spectra.pdf#page=5">manual</a>. It even has a built-in sonar autofocus system that indicates how far the object in focus is. Since the production of spectra films ceased in 2019, I moded my polaroid to accept the newer films such as 600 and i-type. Since the original films included a battery inside, with a lot of difficulty, I had to provide a source of power supply externally - 4 conventional 1.5v batteries. The 600 films include a battery inside them that matches the specs of the spectra system cameras, but it doesn't seem sane to me to drop extra argent for the included battery when I can use the cheap 1.5v batteries to finish off 10 packs of i-type films. Since the size of the available instant films do not match the dimensions of the original films, there are some visible artifacts in the image rolling out of the camera. More specifically, the articats mostly are attributed to nonuniform pressure exerted by rollers inside the camera rolling out the film. This nonuniform pressure can be mittigated by trial and error for the i-type, and 600 films. But for me the artifacts are acceptible and add a magical twist to them.

    <p>I will put the url to the video I followed to open up the camera to access the internals and connect the batteries to the power supply circuitry. <a href="https://youtu.be/InA3IzhkKg8?si=AtxbEGw3wwvEluM9">Video Link</a></p>
